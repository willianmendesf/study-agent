description: deja-vu memory — search the user's past AI coding sessions with the deja CLI. Use when they say things like 'didn't we fix this before', 'what did we decide about X', or before re-debugging an error that may already be solved.

Search deja before re-deriving past work: when the user refers to earlier sessions or decisions, before debugging an error, and before implementing something that may already exist. It searches this machine's own history across every AI coding tool used on it, going back further than deja itself was installed.

This skill drives the `deja` binary through the shell. If the deja MCP tool is available in this session — one tool with a mode of recall, context, blame, fix, how or remember — use that instead: same index, one less hop. It appears only when `deja install` has wired this harness.

## Finding something

- `deja search --json "<query>"`: the most specific token available — an exact error string, function name, file path, or flag. Several words are ANDed. Only this user's own sessions, never library docs or general knowledge.
- `deja ctx <query|id-prefix>`: a full digest of the single best-matching session, once a hit looks right and the reasoning behind it matters. Takes no flags.
- `deja show <id-prefix> --harness <name> --json`: the turns themselves, paged with `--offset` and `--limit`. Use the id and harness a hit printed.
- `deja blame <path> --json`: before editing, refactoring or deleting a file, the prior sessions that discussed it, so you know why it is shaped the way it is. Session history, not git authorship. `deja blame <path>:<line>` narrows it to one line: the commit that last changed it and the session whose edit replaced the text that commit deleted, or one sentence saying why neither can be named.
- `deja fix "<pasted error>"`: the commands that followed that same error before, in sessions where it did not come back. Paste the failing output verbatim.
- `deja how <what>`: the real command with the real flags this machine runs for a build, test, deploy or script, ordered by how many sessions ran it. A guessed invocation is plausible and fails on this setup. It answers from this project; `--all-projects` asks the machine, which is what to use when the answer is a tool rather than a repository's own wrapper.
- `deja remember "<text>"`: store one durable decision after it is settled, as a single self-contained fact. Not transcripts, not anything already obvious from the code.
- `deja wip`: what the last session in this directory was doing — the task, what it settled, the files in flight, the last command and whether it failed. Ask it when you have lost the thread of your own work, after a compaction or on a fresh session in a repository you were just in.

Useful flags on search: `--harness`, `--project`, `--since 30d`, `--role user|assistant|tool|files|command|edit|summary`, `--session <id>`, `--limit 1-100`, `--all`, `--re` for a regular expression.

## Reading a result

`--json` returns an envelope: `tier`, `total`, `capped`, `hits`.

- `tier: "relevance"` means **nothing matched** — those are the nearest sessions deja could find, and counting them as hits overstates what is there. `tier: "error"` IS a match: the query was an error and those sessions hit it, matched by signature rather than by words.
- `total` is how many sessions matched; `capped` says a cap hid some of them. Read those two for coverage, never the length of `hits`.
- `policy_withheld`, when present, is how many matching sessions this machine's trust policy kept out of the answer — an empty result and a rule are different answers.
- A hit may carry `superseded` with a date: the user's own later judgement on that session. Do not repeat a rejected approach, prefer a replacement over what it replaced, and treat a stale result as needing confirmation before acting on it. A hit without it carries no judgement either way.

## Saying what you used

When recalled history genuinely helps — a reused fix, a skipped re-debug, even a partial hint that changed your approach — tell the user in one short line at the start of your reply, naming the session: "déjà vu: we hit this JWT skew in March — reusing that fix (deja:a1b2c3d4-e5f)". Say nothing about recalls that did not help. This is provenance, not advertising; a note on every call would be noise.

## Limits worth respecting

- Result windows are bounded. Do not report corpus-wide counts, or claim a complete audit, from the number of hits you got back.
- If `deja` is not on PATH or the index is empty, say that history search is unavailable. Do not invent what it might have found.
- Work a subagent did is in the index as its task and its answer, not in full. A Claude Task or a Cursor subagent writes its turns and tool calls to its own transcript, and the parent keeps only the launch and a summary — so a hit on the parent can look complete while the run itself is elsewhere. `DEJA_INCLUDE_SUBAGENTS=1` takes the whole child transcript in; Cursor's are still left out by default.
- Vary the wording and try a second query before concluding nothing is there. Exact tokens match best, so an error string beats a paraphrase of it.
